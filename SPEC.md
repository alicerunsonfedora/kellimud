# Realm of the Mad Tom - Spec Writeup

## Basic dungeon gameplay
The player spawns in the dungeon (a 3 x 3 grid) and placed in the upper left-hand corner. Monsters will randomly generate in other areas of the grid ("rooms") and trnasfer locations at any given point. Rooms will contain doors that allow access to other rooms based upon their position in the dungeon. Loot will also randomly generate in the rooms; items can include weapons, healing potions, etc.

The player must defeat monsters and collect items to reach a maximum level (currently 42).
